"""Library mount registry — pointers to external knowledge, never copies.

The mount registry backs the Library overlay's Mounted section. A mount is a
lightweight row {id, scope, path, kind, briefing, index_ref, last_synced, health,
enabled, created_at} — a POINTER into the user's disk, indexed IN PLACE by the
engine best suited to its kind (code → code_intel graph; docs → briefing cards on
the FTS5 library leg). This module owns ONLY the registry (CRUD + source-exists
health); indexing + ownership-plan-A live in later cycles.

Design: Knowledge/Designs/2026-08-02-library-mount-points-design.md (Cycle 2).

Deliberate architecture (Gate-1 revision + R25): this store SELF-OWNS its schema
via ensure_table() — the KnowledgeStore(conn) pattern — so it never touches the
CRITICAL 263-caller database/sqlite.py. It takes a sqlite3.Connection, making it
trivially testable with an in-memory DB and decoupled from the app DB lifecycle.

Index-not-warehouse invariant: this store holds a `path` string + a `briefing`
snapshot, never the external content. Health only reports whether the pointer is
still valid; recall reads the LIVE source on a hit.
